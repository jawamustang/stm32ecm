# stm32f072rb cdc ecm
USB CDC-ECM implementation for STM32F072

Original project: https://github.com/majbthrd/stm32ecm
The original project needed a specific ide (with its own compiler), 
this version uses makefile. 
It compiles and runs, but I haven't yet prepared LED pin outputs.
Windows doesn't have CDC_ECM drivers.
The device address is 192.168.7.1
